          <p>BlackJack, or 21, is a common casino game which involves dealing with probabilities. 
              The purpose of the game is to have a greater card sum than the dealer without going over 21. 
              The card sum, or count, works by adding your card values together, where the number cards 
              refer to its number, i.e. a card that is a 6 would add 6 to your count, and face cards 
              (Jack, Queen, King) are all worth 10, and the ace is valued at either 1 or 11, depending 
              on what your count is. Everyone receives 2 cards and reveals their hand, while the dealer 
              keeps one of their cards concealed, and players can either receive another card and hope 
              they do not go over 21 and “bust”, or stay and hope that the dealer has a lower hand or that 
              they “bust”. The dealer, on the other hand, has a more fixated structure of playing: if they 
              have a count of 16 or less, they must take an additional card, and if the dealer has a count 
              of 17 or over, they must stay. The dealer continues with their specific deck that is unshuffled 
              until they run out of cards, where they shuffle the deck and start the dealing process once again.</p>
      
          <p>
              One thing people do to supplement their betting patterns is “counting cards”. Essentially 
              what it is doing is keeping track of the amount of cards that are high-value and low-value 
              to better understand the likelihood of busting when the next card is dealt. Counting cards 
              is difficult because it requires mentally keeping track of counts of several different 
              categories of cards and counting cards only works if the player starts counting when the 
              dealer first deals the shuffled deck. In other words, a player cannot begin counting cards 
              when half of the cards in the current deck have already been played, it will be impossible 
              to get an accurate count of the cards that have already been played.

          <h1> Simulation Game </h1>
          <p> Below, We are going to show how data visualization helps making it easier to understand the 
              process of counting cards. We can see this through this simulated game where we have dynamic 
              bar charts showing the information on probabilities and the count of the deck.</p>
